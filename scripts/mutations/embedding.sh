# Mutation cases for the indexing-and-embedding cycle.

# Each `case` breaks exactly one thing and names the test that must go red.
# Cases are added by the task that adds the test they protect, so this file
# grows through the cycle rather than being written once at the end.

# The doc comment above `clear_document_content_in` calls the ordering
# load-bearing, not stylistic: swept after the page delete instead of before
# it, `delete_vectors_for_document_in` runs its `WHERE chunk_id IN (SELECT id
# FROM chunk WHERE document_id = ?1)` once the cascade has already taken every
# chunk naming that document, so the subquery finds none and deletes nothing.
# Same file, same two lines, the other order — one case per test it must
# still catch, since `case_` names one test at a time.
